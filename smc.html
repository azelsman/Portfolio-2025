          Santa’s Magic Call: A Safe, Magical Human+AI Experience
        </h1>

        <p class="subtitle">
          Staff/Principal Product Designer &amp; Experience Architect — Zero-to-one Human+AI Santa experience for kids,
          built in about a month with safety, story, and systems at the core.
        </p>

        <p>
          Santa’s Magic Call is a real-time, voice-only Santa experience for kids, powered by AI and built to feel magical,
          safe, and human. It gives parents a way to create a warm Christmas moment without more screen time or creepy AI behavior—
          and it gives teams a concrete example of how a beloved character can live as a live, responsive system.
        </p>

        <p>
          I took Santa’s Magic Call from idea to an end-to-end Human+AI prototype in about a month: defining the brand and promise,
          designing Santa’s persona and story arc, writing the safety rails that protect kids, and architecting the full system—
          landing page, Stripe checkout, Make automation, magic-link tokens, and a time-limited ElevenLabs voice agent—plus the
          story-driven go-to-market around it.
        </p>

        <p class="note">
          Beyond Santa, this is a proof of a reusable Human+AI pattern: translating human intent and mental models into reliable AI
          behavior through clear constraints (contracts), gating logic, and deterministic experience outcomes (arc, safety, redirects).
        </p>

        <h2 id="smc-experience-modeling-loop-title">Experience Modeling decision loop</h2>
        <p>
          The biggest leverage wasn’t generating content—it was accelerating decisions. I interacted with parent and child personas
          and reviewed key moments through SME, psychology, and marketing lenses to stress-test tone, trust, and safety before scale.
          That loop compressed ambiguity into clarity and gave me the confidence to design and build the end-to-end experience in about a month.
        </p>
        <p class="note">
          Instead of waiting for traction data, I used persona + expert-lens pressure testing to make safer, faster product decisions under uncertainty.

        <p>
          Most families know two versions of Santa: the rushed mall visit and the endless scroll of holiday content.
          Both are loud, overstimulating, and rarely built around what kids actually need—a calm, warm moment where they feel seen.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the same time, many teams are under pressure to “do something with AI” but avoid kid-facing experiences because the stakes are high.
          One awkward response or unsafe topic can damage trust with parents and the brand.
        </p>
        <ul class="po-moves">
          <li><strong>Warm, human, magical:</strong> Design a real-time, voice-only Santa experience that feels genuinely magical—not robotic, salesy, or gimmicky.</li>
          <li><strong>Emotional safety:</strong> Keep children emotionally and psychologically safe in every interaction.</li>
          <li><strong>Myth protection:</strong> Protect the Santa myth and family traditions without overexplaining how the magic works.</li>
          <li><strong>Parent simplicity &amp; trust:</strong> Make it simple and trustworthy enough that a busy parent will use it once and feel good about using it again.</li>
          <li><strong>Lean operations:</strong> Run the service reliably with one human plus AI agents and automations during a short holiday window—no large support team.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note">
          The goal wasn’t a clever AI demo. It was to prove that a beloved character could live as a live Human+AI system that parents actually trust—
          with clear safety rails, simple access, and a story that feels good on the other side of the call. If it works for Santa, the pattern can extend to other characters, IP, and experiential brands.

        <h2 id="smc-vision-title">Vision &amp; Objectives</h2>
        <ul class="po-moves">
          <li><strong>Vision:</strong> Create a Santa experience that feels like it was designed by someone who understands both kids and AI—a cozy, real-time voice call where a child’s imagination, not their wishlist, powers the magic.</li>
          <li><strong>Child experience:</strong> Deliver a five-minute call that feels personal, calm, and playful for shy, high-energy, and imaginative kids alike.</li>
          <li><strong>Emotional focus:</strong> Center the interaction on the child’s “spark”—their kindness, creativity, and feelings—rather than on gifts or consumption.</li>
          <li><strong>Safety &amp; myth:</strong> Keep language and pacing gentle, preserve Santa’s warmth and myth, and never break character or expose the mechanics behind the magic.</li>
          <li><strong>System pattern:</strong> Use Santa’s Magic Call as a flagship pattern for Human+AI experiences that can extend to other IP and experiential brands.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note">
          In short, the vision was to make Santa feel small and human on the outside—and to design a Human+AI system inside that families and brands can trust.

      <!-- Approach -->
      <section id="smc-approach" aria-labelledby="smc-approach-title">
        <h2 id="smc-approach-title">Approach</h2>
        <p>
          To keep this case skimmable, the deep details live in visuals and the demo. At a high level, my approach was:
        </p>
        <ul class="po-moves">
          <li><strong>Design Santa as a live character, not just a prompt:</strong> Emotional pillars, voice and tone, and myth rules (no naughty list, no breaking the magic) to keep Santa consistent and warm.</li>
          <li><strong>Bake safety and ethics in from day one:</strong> Forbidden topics, redirect patterns, and soft landings for sensitive moments, guided by a synthesized Childhood Advisory Council.</li>
          <li><strong>Architect the Human+AI system behind the magic:</strong> End-to-end flow (Stripe → Make → magic link → time-limited ElevenLabs call) so one human plus AI agents can run the experience reliably.</li>
          <li><strong>Structure the call as emotional beats, not a script:</strong> A five-minute arc of greeting → Elf name → Snow Globe problem → wish → deeper feeling → identity-affirming close, tuned for different child types.</li>
          <li><strong>Extend the same story into marketing:</strong> Hero video, Elf Orientation, and short-form concepts (Mallet Test, How to Hide a Pony, Snow Globe “hypnotist” clips, QR campaigns) as an outer ring of the same narrative.</li>
          <li><strong>Use Experience Modeling to rehearse edge cases:</strong> Synthetic child/parent personas and advisory agents to tune language, spot risk, and adjust safety rails before live families use the system.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="note">
          The result is a Human+AI experience where character, safety, system, and story are all designed as one.

        <h2 id="smc-takeaways-title">Takeaways</h2>
        <p>
          This project put all of my ideas about Human+AI experiences under real pressure. I had to make hard tradeoffs, live inside the edge cases, and design for the moments that could quietly go wrong for a child or a parent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Along the way I validated a lot of what I’ve been working toward—Experience Modeling, safety-first design, story and system evolving together—and I came out with something I’m proud of: a Santa experience that feels small and human on the outside, and carries a lot of thought and care on the inside.
