          <h1>American Family Insurance – Leading Remote Teams, Driving Innovation, and Leveraging AI for Transformation</h1>
          <p class="lead">
            I led a fully remote UX team spread across locations. We lacked direct customer access, products were complex, and work was siloed. My focus was to unify the team, create a shared innovation cadence, and use AI to accelerate discovery and decision-making.

          <h2>Challenge</h2>
          <p>
            A fully remote, multi-location team with strong individual talent was working in silos.
            The UX team lacked direct customer access, and complex products were difficult to explain
            internally and to prospects—resulting in inconsistent experiences and slower progress toward business goals.

            <div class="card-content">
              <p>Fragmented tools, scattered workflows, and siloed communication — the reality before introducing remote design rituals and AI-assisted discovery.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h2>Vision</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Unite a distributed team through virtual collaboration and a shared innovation mindset.</li>
            <li>Harness AI and modern frameworks to accelerate discovery, streamline workflows, and simplify complex offerings.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Approach</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Introduced design thinking frameworks adapted for remote environments, running collaborative workshops in
              virtual tools (e.g., Miro, MURAL, Figma) so cross-functional teams could ideate and align in real time.
            </li>
            
            <li>
              Leveraged AI-assisted discovery to synthesize insights from existing data, market research, and behavioral analytics,
              enabling informed decisions without traditional user interviews.
            </li>
            <li>
              Developed AI-driven “northstar” chat prototypes—conceptual conversational experiences to help customers navigate
              complex insurance options. While not implemented, these served as visionary artifacts shaping future strategy.
            </li>
