            <ul class="po-moves">
              <li>American Family Insurance’s <strong>digital sales experience was fragmented</strong> across multiple legacy systems, leading to inconsistent interactions and customer confusion.</li>
              <li><strong>Different usage patterns drove unique drop-off behaviors:</strong> some customers were shoppers comparing quotes, others were ready to buy, some used the tool to validate agent-provided quotes, and others reached “hard stops” requiring agent support.</li>
              <li><strong>Lack of behavioral insight</strong> made it difficult to tailor the experience to user intent or identify when to transition from digital to human assistance.</li>
              <li><strong>Distributed UX and product teams</strong> worked in parallel with limited access to direct customer feedback, creating misalignment and redundant efforts.</li>
              <li><strong>Digital satisfaction scores lagged behind competitors,</strong> signaling the need for a cohesive, insight-driven strategy that unified the self-service experience end to end.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="note">
              Understanding how customers used — and abandoned — the journey became the foundation for redesigning AmFam’s digital sales platform around clarity, intent, and measurable performance.

          <h2 id="afi-approach-title">Approach</h2>
          <ul class="po-moves">
            <li><strong>Introduced Design Thinking frameworks</strong> adapted for remote environments — running virtual workshops in Miro, MURAL, and Figma so cross-functional teams could ideate and align in real time.</li>
            <li><strong>Leveraged AI-assisted discovery</strong> to synthesize insights from behavioral analytics, market research, and existing data, enabling evidence-based decisions without traditional user interviews.</li>
            <li><strong>Developed AI-driven “North Star” chat prototypes</strong> — conceptual conversational experiences that helped envision how customers might navigate complex insurance options. While not implemented, these visionary artifacts shaped long-term digital strategy.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="note">
            By blending human-centered design with emerging AI tools, the team accelerated discovery, improved collaboration, and created a shared vision for the future of digital sales.
