          <h2 id="afi-challenge-title">Challenge</h2>
          <ul class="po-moves">
            <li><strong>American Family Insurance’s digital sales experience was fragmented</strong> across multiple legacy systems, leading to inconsistent interactions and customer confusion.</li>
            <li><strong>Different usage patterns drove unique drop-off behaviors:</strong> some customers were shoppers comparing quotes, others were ready to buy, some used the tool to validate agent-provided quotes, and others reached “hard stops” requiring agent support.</li>
            <li><strong>Lack of behavioral insight</strong> made it difficult to tailor the experience to user intent or identify when to transition from digital to human assistance.</li>
            <li><strong>Distributed UX and product teams</strong> worked in parallel with limited access to direct customer feedback, creating misalignment and redundant efforts.</li>
            <li><strong>Digital satisfaction scores lagged behind competitors,</strong> signaling the need for a cohesive, insight-driven strategy that unified the self-service experience end-to-end.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="note"><em>
            Understanding how customers used — and abandoned — the journey became the foundation for redesigning AmFam’s digital sales platform around clarity, intent, and measurable performance.

          <ul class="po-moves">
            <li><strong>Unite</strong> distributed design and product teams around a shared digital-sales vision and repeatable delivery rhythm.</li>
            <li><strong>Leverage</strong> AI and behavioral insights to accelerate discovery, guide customer decisions, and inform product strategy.</li>
            <li><strong>Build</strong> an enterprise design-system framework spanning 21 brands — aligning UX, engineering, and brand for faster, more consistent releases.</li>

        <section id="afi-approach" aria-labelledby="afi-approach-title">
          <h2 id="afi-approach-title">Approach</h2>
          <ul class="po-moves">
            <li><strong>Operationalized Design Thinking</strong> for a fully remote environment — facilitating collaborative workshops in Miro, Figma, and Microsoft Teams that aligned product, CX, and engineering in real time while building shared language and creative confidence across teams.</li>
            <li><strong>Evaluated UX maturity</strong> using Nielsen Norman Group’s model to assess team performance and identify gaps. Introduced tailored frameworks and collaboration rituals that helped a 35-designer organization move beyond a mid-level assessment toward strategic alignment and measurable growth.</li>
            <li><strong>Activated AI-assisted discovery</strong> to synthesize insights from behavioral analytics, market research, and existing data — enabling faster, evidence-based decisions and demonstrating how AI could enhance the UX research process.</li>
            <li><strong>Prototyped AI-driven “North Star” experiences</strong> — conceptual conversational interfaces that envisioned how customers could explore complex insurance choices with clarity and confidence. While not implemented, these prototypes informed long-term digital strategy and product vision.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="note">
            By pairing structured maturity evaluation with Design Thinking and AI innovation, UX evolved from a functional discipline to a strategic capability — scaling consistency, collaboration, and creative impact across the enterprise.

          <h2 id="afi-takeaways-title">Takeaways</h2>
          <ul class="po-moves">
            <li><strong>Distance isn’t a barrier — clarity is.</strong> Remote collaboration and structured frameworks turned distributed delivery into measurable progress.</li>
            <li><strong>UX must evolve from service to strategy.</strong> Many organizations still treat design as a production function, missing its value as a driver of business alignment, risk reduction, and product-market clarity.</li>
            <li><strong>Frameworks create foresight.</strong> Investing in Design Thinking and evidence-based discovery prevents costly rework later — shifting “fix it later” cultures toward “design it right” outcomes.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="note">
            Building stronger partnerships between UX, product, and business isn’t just about process—it’s about changing how organizations think, decide, and invest in customer experience.
