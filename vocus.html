            <h2>Starting Point</h2>
            <p>
              After multiple acquisitions, the Vocus Marketing Cloud had become a set of siloed PR, Social Media, Analytics, and Email Marketing modules with inconsistent interfaces and fragmented workflows. Teams lacked a unified KPI dashboard to track sentiment, engagement, and campaign performance—resulting in high training costs, frequent support tickets, and manual reconciliation.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Fragmented ecosystem with inconsistent patterns across legacy and new modules.</li>
              <li>No unified KPI dashboard to provide at-a-glance performance metrics.</li>
              <li>High training and support costs due to disjointed workflows.</li>
              <li>Lack of a cohesive design system and shared UX vision across teams.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Vision &amp; Objectives</h2>
            <p>
              Establish a scalable UX practice to integrate PR, Social, and Email into a single coherent suite—anchored by a unified KPI dashboard—to streamline workflows, drive cross-sell, and deliver measurable operational efficiencies.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Unify PR, Social, and Email with a single KPI dashboard to reduce support and training costs.</li>
              <li>Create seamless workflows with consistent authoring, scheduling, and publishing patterns.</li>
              <li>Deliver two MVP-level releases in 12 months using Lean UX sprints.</li>
              <li>Build a centralized design system to support continuous research and data-driven decisions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Leadership Moves</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Build UX from the ground up:</b> Started as a solo UX lead, scaled to four designers, and embedded UX into product development processes.</li>
              <li><b>Align cross-functional teams:</b> Facilitated workshops to bring acquired teams under a shared design language and roadmap.</li>
              <li><b>Balance speed and quality:</b> Applied Lean UX sprints to meet aggressive delivery goals while maintaining usability and research rigor.</li>
              <li><b>Institute design-ops:</b> Created component libraries, specifications, and review processes to ensure consistency and scalability.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Innovation in Action</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Discovery &amp; Prioritization:</b> Conducted 15+ interviews and 8 workshops to produce personas, user journeys, and a prioritized 30-story backlog.</li>
              <li><b>Lean UX Sprints:</b> Two-week discovery–design–validate cycles to manage scope and iterate rapidly.</li>
              <li><b>Iterative Ideation:</b> Progressed from low-fidelity sketches and whiteboarding to high-fidelity Illustrator and Photoshop blueprints.</li>
              <li><b>Design-Ops Integration:</b> Established centralized design file management, naming conventions, and specification templates for developer handoff.</li>
              <li><b>Scaling the Practice:</b> Integrated an acquired design team into shared processes, growing UX capacity from 1 to 4 designers.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Key Solutions</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Single KPI Dashboard:</b> Customizable “pane of glass” view with sentiment, engagement, and campaign performance widgets.</li>
              <li><b>Unified Navigation:</b> Global header with Plan / Publish / Analyze mega-menus, breadcrumbs, and in-app search.</li>
              <li><b>Streamlined Authoring:</b> Single Create modal for press releases, social posts, and emails with guided, component-driven forms.</li>
              <li><b>Real-Time Insights:</b> Header alerts for mentions/spikes with one-click drilldowns to analytics.</li>
              <li><b>Design-Ops Handoff:</b> Illustrator/Photoshop specifications and component sheets reviewed weekly to keep delivery aligned.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Impact &amp; Results</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Rapid Delivery:</b> Two MVP releases in 12 months, meeting aggressive roadmap targets.</li>
              <li><b>Operational Efficiency:</b> Support load reduced; training shifted from multi-day sessions to self-serve in-app guidance.</li>
              <li><b>User Satisfaction:</b> Positive feedback citing smoother workflows, fewer context switches, and clearer handoffs.</li>
              <li><b>Organizational Growth:</b> UX recognized as a strategic function; Lean UX embedded across product lines.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
