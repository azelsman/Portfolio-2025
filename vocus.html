            <li>The project reinforced how clarity, communication, and shared ownership drive sustainable design outcomes.</li>
            <li><strong>Co-creation builds momentum:</strong> Early collaboration between design, product, and engineering accelerated delivery and trust.</li>
            <li><strong>Design systems are culture, not tools:</strong> Governance and shared understanding mattered more than components alone.</li>
            <li><strong>Accessible design is scalable design:</strong> Building inclusively early prevented rework and improved overall quality.</li>
            <li><strong>Documentation drives continuity:</strong> Clear specs and annotations ensured fidelity after team transitions.</li>
            <li><strong>Vision must stay visible:</strong> Reiterating the north star through each sprint kept priorities aligned and teams focused.</li>
