            <p class="i-m-a-UX-and-product">
            I’m a UX and Product Design leader with 20+ years of experience translating vision into emotionally resonant,
            intuitive digital experiences. I began my career as a videographer and animator, where I learned that
            storytelling isn’t just a tool—it’s the core of influence. That belief continues to shape every product,
            brand, and experience I bring to life.

                Today, I operate at the intersection of design, neuroscience, AI, and marketing strategy—blending creative
                intuition with scientific insight to move people and shape behavior. My journey has led me to study:<br /><br />Neuroscience
                – to understand the psychology of emotion, motivation, and decision-making<br />Neuro-Linguistic Programming
                (NLP) – to decode and reframe the mental models that drive human behavior<br />Innovative learning
                strategies – to accelerate mastery and creative development<br />Artificial Intelligence – from generative
                tools for storytelling and video, to agentic AI for automation, guidance, and ideation<br />Marketing
                strategy – with a focus on viral video and narrative formats that amplify reach and emotional impact

            Whether I’m mentoring design teams, leading product innovation, or creating story-driven content with AI, my
            focus is always the same: to distill complexity into clarity, spark curiosity, and deliver experiences that
            resonate.<br /><br />My passion for art, animation, and storytelling remains as strong as ever—only now, I’ve
            found a powerful partner in AI. Together, we’re pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in design,
            marketing, and human-centered innovation.
